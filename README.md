**ðŸš§ WORK IN PROGRESS, EACH COMMIT MOST LIKELY BREAKS THE LAST ðŸš§**

Application for managing and viewing Dahua devices.

TODO: explain why this program exists

https://github.com/ItsNotGoodName/ipcmanview/assets/35015993/f2c73450-ba61-4d39-b3c5-92eaa719fced

# Features

- Single binary<sub>1</sub>
- View device information (e.g. software version, license, storage, â€¦)
- Subscribe to device events
- View live stream of cameras
- View snapshot of cameras
- Publish to MQTT with Home Assistant MQTT discovery
- View files on devices (only local, SFTP, and FTP storage locations are supported)

1. Streaming requires [MediaMTX](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx), and [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) requires a [MQTT broker](https://mosquitto.org/).

# Usage

```
ipcmanview serve
```

# Roadmap

Roadmap is in order of importance.

- Support syncing the config `VideoInMode` (Camera > Conditions > Profile Management) with sunrise and sunset
- Support editing the config `General` (System > General)
- Support editing the config `Email` (Network > SMTP(Email))
- Support editing the config `VideoAnalyseRule`
- View DAV files in local storage via RTSP (see 4.1.3 in the Dahua HTTP API PDF)
- Create and cache thumbnails for files
- Act as a HomeKit bridge for viewing cameras
- Support two-way talk on cameras that support it (see [./pkg/dahuacgi/audio.go](./pkg/dahuacgi/audio.go))
- Support OpenAPI (but I don't want to write more YAML then there is code in the handlers)
