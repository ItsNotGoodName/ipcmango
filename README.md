# Roadmap

Roadmap is in order of importance.

- Support syncing the config `VideoInMode` (Camera > Conditions > Profile Management) with sunrise and sunset
- Support editing the config `General` (System > General)
- Support editing the config `Email` (Network > SMTP(Email))
- Support editing the config `VideoAnalyseRule`
- View live stream on cameras
- View DAV files in local storage via RTSP (see 4.1.3 in the Dahua HTTP API PDF)
- Create and cache thumbnails for files
- Act as a HomeKit bridge for viewing cameras
- Support two-way talk on cameras that support it (see [./pkg/dahuacgi/audio.go](./pkg/dahuacgi/audio.go))
- Support OpenAPI (but I don't want to write more YAML then there is code in the handlers)
